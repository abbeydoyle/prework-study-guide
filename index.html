          <li>Text, image, header, list elements used to add content to pages</li>
          <li>Meta-related, content division, semantic elements used to divide and describe pages</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets </li>
          <li>Head elements are not visible on webpage</li>
          <li>All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside body element</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS used to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>applies to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
          <li>useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change</li>
          <li>ie h1 heading</li>
          <li>possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
          <li>a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements</li>
          <li>external CSS style sheet is the most common way to style a webpage</li>
          <li>allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use</li>
          <li>selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer</li>
          <li>padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element</li>
          <li>CSS Box Model - every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase</li>
          <li>CSS added to head at beginning</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
          <li>class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule</li>
          <li>can use hex numbers to assign colors</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
