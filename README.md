# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide coincidentally began as a personal Microsoft Word document that I had started of my own volition throughout the introductory prework modules. Once I reached module 3, I began this official Prework Study Guide as an assignment and was able to add a fair amount of my previously accumulated notes. Included topics are Git, HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Installation

This is the first installation. I intend to resubmit this study guide with a higher level of CSS customization to further reflect my own aesthetic and aspirations as a developer.

## Usage

Use this webpage to review notes for Git, HTML, CSS, and JS. Study suggestions can be found in Chrome DevTools in the console tab.

## Credits
